Plumitas is a pythonic package for analysis and visualization of the output
files from molecular dynamics (MD) performed with the open source enhanced
sampling package [Plumed](https://plumed.github.io/). This package is developed and
maintained by the [Pfaendtner Research Group](http://prg.washington.edu/) in the Department of Chemical Engineering
at the University of Washington, Seattle. We have developed this package to improve
the consistency and speed of our own research, but we hope it will aid other
researchers in performing efficient, transparent research. More info about using
and contributing to this project to come...

Immediately significant information:
- support planned for **`python 3.6+`** only.
